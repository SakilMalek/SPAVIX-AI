# 🏠 SPAVIX-Vision - AI-Powered Room Transformation Platform

## Project Overview

**SPAVIX-Vision** is an intelligent interior design platform that uses advanced AI to transform room images into professionally styled spaces. Built during my college internship, this project leverages Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash AI to provide instant room redesigns with photorealistic results.

### Core Technology
- **2-Stage AI Pipeline**: First detects room type (bathroom, kitchen, bedroom, etc.), then applies style transformations while respecting room-specific constraints
- **Smart Room Detection**: Prevents illogical outputs (e.g., no toilets in living rooms, no sofas in bathrooms)
- **Photorealistic Rendering**: Maintains original room geometry, camera angles, and object placement while changing colors, finishes, and decor

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Radix UI
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL
- **AI**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (image generation) + Gemini Vision (room detection)
- **Auth**: JWT with refresh tokens + Google OAuth 2.0
- **Payments**: Stripe (planned)

## 💬 Internship Project Message

> "I developed SPAVIX-Vision during my college internship as a full-stack AI application. The project started as a simple room styling tool but evolved into a comprehensive platform with advanced features like intelligent room detection, user authentication, project management, and transformation history tracking.
> 
> Currently, I'm planning to expand it into a SaaS product with tiered subscription plans to make professional interior design accessible to everyone—from casual users to interior design agencies. The goal is to democratize interior design using AI while maintaining professional-grade quality."
